    "## Rat hexmaze import data script\n",
    "\n",
    "This script achieves the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads all rat hexmaze experimental logs in a given directory, removing duplicate lines and duplicate trials, storing all data as a pandas dataframe\n",
    "2. Performs basic data ingegrity verification, assuring:\n",
    "    - Temporal consistency of read data (i.e., all times recorded are ascending throughout session)\n",
    "    - Experimental integrity: rat only passess through target node once, and always at the end of the trial\n",
    "    - Between-column consistency (e.g. speed equal to distance / time)\n",
    "3. A cleaned version of the dataframe is generated, removing trials not meeting the above criteria\n",
    "4. New useful columns are added to the clean data, to assist in posterior data exploration\n",
    "5. Both the full dataframe generated in step 1 and the clean, enriched dataframe generated in step 4 are saved to a csv file for easy loading for subsequent exploration and analysis\n",
    "6. The results of import and cleaning operations are saved to a logfile. Both the generated csvs and the import logfile names include the date of execution of the present script."
